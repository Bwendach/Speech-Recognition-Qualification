*Heart Sound Classification with Deep Learning
This project implements a deep learning model for the classification of heart sounds. The model is trained to distinguish between different types of heart conditions, such as Aortic Stenosis and Mitral Stenosis, as well as a normal heart sound.

Project Files
BD24_2_Speech_Recog_Qualification.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the complete code for the project, including:

Data Preparation: Code to download and extract the dataset from a GitHub repository.

Model Architecture: A deep learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras, specifically designed for audio classification tasks.

Training and Evaluation: The process of training the model on the heart sound data and evaluating its performance.

Results: A summary of the model's accuracy, showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language.

TensorFlow & Keras: Used for building and training the deep learning model.

NumPy: Essential for numerical operations and data manipulation.

Matplotlib: Used for data visualization, if any is included in the notebook.

SciPy: Used for reading audio (.wav) files.

Summary of Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 81.25%, correctly classifying 104 out of 128 data samples. The output of the notebook provides a detailed breakdown of the predictions for each data point, indicating which labels were predicted correctly and which were incorrect.
